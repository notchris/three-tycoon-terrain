# THREE Tycoon Terrain

![Terrain Preview](https://i.imgur.com/nLTIJM4.png)

An experiment with [conartist6](https://github.com/conartist6) to replicate the classic 1999 "tycoon" terrain in [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

Shoutout to [Peter Ellis Jones](https://github.com/peterellisjones) who wrote an awesome [article](https://peterellisjones.com/posts/generating-transport-tycoon-terrain/) about this topic. Their findings helped a lot with this demo.

## Installation

Install with npm or yarn.

```bash
yarn
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

## TODO

- Terrain Editing
- Surface Sampler (Add instanced trees, etc)
- Implement textures in shader
- Improve water (maybe add animation via shader?)
